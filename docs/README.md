features:
- title: 😎 Developer happiness
  details: Forms are everywhere, yet surprisingly tedious to author — well, not anymore. Vue Formulate provides a powerful and flexible API to developers that makes complex form creation a breeze.
- title: ☝️ A single input element
  details: With Vue Formulate you don't need to remember the names of a dozen components — all form elements are created with a single component. Easy!
- title: 🎯 Built-in validation
  details: Ridiculously easy validation out-of-the-box to handle 95% of use-cases. Help text, validation rules, and validation messages are simple props. Need more? You can add custom validations too.
- title: 🔌 Plugin system
  details: Extend Vue Formulate's functionality or reuse custom inputs, validation rules, and messages across projects by tapping into the plugin system. Make your plugin open source to share with others!
- title: ✨ Generate forms
  details: Generate an entire form from a JSON string. Because Vue Formulate uses a single input component, you can easily loop through an array and dynamically generate a form.
- title: 🎨 Bring your own styles
  details: Vue Formulate has simple semantic classes that make styling inputs a snap. Roll your own styles or choose one of our pre-baked themes.
