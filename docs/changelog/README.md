## v2.4.1 - June 22, 2020

- Adds support for Polish language 🇵🇱.
- Updates Korean translation removing generic particles.

## v2.4.0 - June 17, 2020

Vue Formulate `2.4.0` is another significant update with some much-anticipated
features:

- Full [class customization](/guide/theming/customizing-classes/) 🎨
  - Includes a robust system for customizing classes on [every DOM element](/guide/theming/customizing-classes/#element-keys).
  - Customize classes based on the [state of an input](/guide/theming/customizing-classes/#class-keys) (ex `hasValue`).
  - Allows for easy customization globally or inline, making it compatible with utility frameworks like [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Adds a robust [schema for form generation](/guide/forms/generating-forms/#generating-forms) 🤖
  - Supports any external components
  - Supports HTML elements
  - Supports element nesting
- Adds support for programmatic form submission using [named forms](/guide/forms/#named-forms).
- Adds support for custom [`slotProps`](/guide/inputs/slots/#declaring-slot-props), top-level props that can be passed into your custom slot components.

## v2.3.8 - June 9, 2020

- Fixes a bug that could cause two identical `@input` events to be fired from a `FormulateInput`.

## v2.3.7 - June 7, 2020

- Adds support for Hebrew language 🇮🇱.

## v2.3.6 - June 4, 2020

- Fixes a bug that caused `formValues` in custom validation messages to be corrupted.

## v2.3.5 - June 4, 2020

- Adds automatic dependency tracking to validation rules that access other form values.

**Example:** A validation rule that ensures `Field C` is equal to the sum of field `Field A` and `Field B`.

The above validation rule would sum values of `A` and `B` and compare equality to `C`. Previously this worked when editing `C`, but if you updated `A` or `B` without touching `C` it would not re-run the validation on `C`. This resulted in bug-like behavior in validation rules like [`confirm`](/guide/validation/#confirm). This version ensures the dependencies of the rule are automatically tracked and validation is re-triggered on any dependent fields.

## v2.3.4 - June 2, 2020

- Adds `rootEmit` to the context object to allow custom inputs to trigger events.
- Adds `data-has-value` attribute to root wrapper when inputs have values.
